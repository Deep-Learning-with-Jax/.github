## Foundations of Machine Learning
This fifteen day crash course is part of course program for incoming phD students at the University of Bonn's [BIGS-Neuroscience](https://bigs-neuroscience.de/) and [BIGS Clinical and Population Science](https://bigs-clinpopscience.de/). We are releasing it here for those of you who could not attend the course in person and in the hope, that it will be useful to a wider audience.

Prerequisites:
Programming in Python. If you are not yet familiar with python, please consult https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/ before the first session.
University level math courses make it much easier to follow the course.

## Course contents:

### Part 1, Basics
- Day 1: Introduction
    - What is machine learning, and what can it do for us?
- Day 2: Optimization
    - The derivative, gradients, optimization via gradient descent.
- Day 3:   Linear Algebra:
   - Matrix multiplication, singular value decomposition, Linear Regression.
- Day 4:  Statistics
   - Mean and variance, correlation, Gaussians.

### Part 2, Deep Learning
- Day 11: Fully connected networks:
    -  The MNIST-data set, artificial neurons, forward and backward pass.
- Day 12: Convolutional neural networks:
    -  The convolution operation and convolutional neural networks.
- Day 13: Optimization for deep neural networks:
    -  Gradient descent with momentum, Adam, early stopping, regularization.
- Day 14: Interpretability:
    - Visualization of linear classifiers, saliency maps, integrated gradients
 - Day 15: Sequence models:
