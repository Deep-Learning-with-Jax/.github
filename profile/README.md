## Foundations of Machine Learning in Python
Three weeks, 15 days, a lecture and exercises every day. The course takes place from September 12 th  to 30 th , 9:00-17:00 at the University of Bonn's IT and Data Center (Hochschulrechenzentrum HRZ). The course structure is 90 minutes lecture, 90 min exercises followed by 4 hrs of programming under guidance from the tutors.

### Prerequisites:
