## Introduction to deep learning
This nine-day crash course is part of the course program for incoming Ph.D. students at the University of Bonn's [BIGS-Neuroscience](https://bigs-neuroscience.de/) and [BIGS Clinical and Population Science](https://bigs-clinpopscience.de/). We are releasing it here for those who could not attend the course in person. Furthermore, we hope that it will help a broader audience.

The material currently consists of lecture videos, slides and exercises.
Most exercises come with unit tests, allowing you to verify your solutions independently. The first exercise explains how to do that.

All exercises will run on Ubuntu 22.04.1 with ffmpeg version 4.4.2.

An extended version of this course is held in person every semester. [Members of the University can register](https://www.hpc.uni-bonn.de/en/training/courses/ml_intro). Attend in person for access to tutoring.


#### Prerequisites:
Programming in Python. If you are unfamiliar with Python, please consult https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/ before starting to work on the course.
Exposure to university-level math courses make it much easier to understand the material. However, participants from our digital humanities groups have completed the course on site.
